## Setup

1. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python app.py
```

**Note:** The script will run on http://0.0.0.0:9100/ by default.
This enables you to access the script from any device on your local network.

## Usage

1. Open the link in your browser.

2. Start speaking the commands (It'll wait for 5 seconds before submitting the command.) If you don't speak, it'll retry.

3. Wait for it to get processed and show the changes

4. Complete the box or win/loose to get the final result


**Note:** The script will use network call to google speech to text API. Make sure you have a good internet connection. (I have used the free version)
